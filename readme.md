## by Ziming Chen


## Prosper Loan Data

> The dataset clearly explains the financial information of borrowers, lenders, investors and related fees and dates. There are 81 columns in the dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> The state that has highest average interest rate is AL and IA has the lowest average interest rate

> Most of people would choose a loan that ends in 36 months

> Employed people should have the higest loan amount on average

> More salary and having house will tend to have more loans.

> Self employed people have less loan but have a much ihger monthly income,one person even has 1M monthly income with a loan less than500 dollars per month

> When people have a stable income source and can show the proof of the income, people tend to have less borrow APR while having the simialr estimated return. This situation makes sense because lender would take more risks by lending the loans to the people who have an unstable source of income. In order to offset the risks, this type of people should take more APR in general.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Conclusion:
I conclude that there are many factors that can influence the loan amount and loan duration such as the geographic location, salary, occupation, and employment status.It it interesting to notice that self-employed tend to be much more wealthy while having less loan in the dataset. Most people have monthly income udner 40000 have less than 1500 dollars loan payment per omnth.A stable income source such as having a full-time job, proof of income source, belongs to certain group, and consistently pay monthly loan payment can show the the lenders that this person has a strong pay back ability now and in the future. Thus, resulting in a less APR with the similar return.
